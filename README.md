# Hangman Game in Ruby

This is a simple Hangman game written in Ruby. It is still under development, but it is playable.

## How to Play

1. Start the game by running the following command:
    ```ruby
    ruby hangman.rb
    ```

2. The computer will choose a random word from a list of words.
3. You will have 7 guesses to try to guess the word.
4. On each turn, you will guess a letter.
5. If the letter is in the word, the computer will reveal that letter.
6. If the letter is not in the word, you lose a guess.
7. The game ends when you either guess the word correctly or run out of guesses.
